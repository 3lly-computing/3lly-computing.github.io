With the early 2020s, the average internet user experienced several upheavals. Twitter got sold to Elon and became unusable, BlueSky is still in its infancy, and Mastodon didn't quite reach critical mass. So I made a blog just like in my childhood!\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There's technically a RSS feed. I'm also committing to quarterly / annual updates.&nbsp;<br>You can always ping me via 3lly.info on BSKY messaging or try emailing Support(at)\"this website's domain name\".&nbsp;\n  </p>",
